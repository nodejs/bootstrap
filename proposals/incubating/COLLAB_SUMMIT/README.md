## Champion

## Description

Organize an OpenJS Collaborator Summit twice a year in two
geographically distinct location (e.g. one in Europe and one in North
America)
following the lead of the [Node.js Collaborator Summit](https://github.com/nodejs/summit).

The goal of the Collaborator Summit is to foster collaboration within
and across projects in the Foundation.

## Required Resources

* Budget for venue
* Budget for travel fund

## Who would be responsible?

The CPC delegates the organization of the Summit to a team/working group
that includes representation from all interested projects and OpenJS staff.
The team/working group will oversee the budget for the venue and the
travel fund.

## How would success be measured?

* numbers of attendees at the Summit. The one in Berlin/Europe 2019 has 70 people
attending.
* number of projects participating in the summit.
* number of decisions made / problems solved.

## Why this proposal is important

Meeting fellow collaborators in person is important for the success of
Open Source projects.

## Unresolved Question

* The Node.js TSC and CommComm jointly approve the Node.js travel fund
  requests in https://github.com/nodejs/admin. The majority of this
  budget is currently spent for attending the summit.
  How will it be managed going forward? It was managed by Node.js, but
  the Collaborator Summit will now be larger than just Node.js. Will
  Node.js maintain their travel fund and a new travel fund will be set up
  for the Foundation as a whole? Will many projects get travel budgets?

## What is necessary to complete this proposal

* Approval from the CPC
* Approval from the Board on the allocated budgets for 2020
