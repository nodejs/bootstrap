# Community fund process proposal

## Champion

Brian Warner (@brianwarner)

## Description

A [draft proposal](./COMMUNITY_FUND_PROCESS.md) for how to handle the logistics of reviewing and approving reimbursements from the OpenJS Foundation CPC community fund.

## Required resources

No additional resources required.

## Who would be responsible

* Foundation staff to execute on the logistics.
* CPC to develop a strategic plan to provide guidelines on intended uses.
* CPC to nominate a budget committee.

## How would success be measured?

* Initially, the scope of success is to establish the logistics necessary to get the program up and running. The minimum measure of success is to consider, approve, and disburse funding using the process established here.
* If it is logistically easier, the guidelines and program goals could be split into a subsequent proposal once the foundations of the program are in place.

## Why this proposal is important

The OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors has allocated money for a CPC-administered community fund. The goal is to use the funding for the benefit of the community. The board has requested that the CPC develop an efficient decision-making process, as well as a plan to effectively use the funding. This proposal focuses specifically on the logistics.

## Unresolved questions

* Who has responsibility for approving requests?
* Who will articulate the strategy for how the community fund will help?
* Who will develop the guidelines for requesting the funds?

## What is necessary to complete this proposal

* Consider and approve a simple set of logistics.
