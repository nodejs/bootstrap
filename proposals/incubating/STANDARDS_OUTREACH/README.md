## Description

[JS Outreach Groups](https://github.com/littledan/js-outreach-groups)
is an effort to have regular calls with various segments of the
JavaScript community, to consult with them on emerging standards.
We're starting with TC39 topics, but I imagine it could be useful for
other standards as well.

## Required Resources

Resources the Foundation could provide to help:
- A neutral home to base this outreach from, which participants can trust. It's awkward to have this as a personal repository.
- Access to attend standards committee meetings for people who are heavily involved in the efforts ("invited expert" can get awkward).

Work involved in this effort includes:
- Identifying constituencies who would have relevant feedback in standards bodies which isn't reaching those standards bodies; calling them up, convincing them to discuss
- Running the meetings, setting agendas, taking notes, publishing the notes
- Going to standards bodies and reporting the feedback of these groups, so that it's taken into account

## Who would be responsible?

I'm not sure; I'd like to not be the only person responsible for this. That's why I'd like to work with the Foundation.

## How would success be measured?

These are squishy metrics, but:
- Standards make better and faster decisions based on feedback from ecosystem stakeholders.
- Key ecosystem stakeholders are better informed about the developments in standards.

## Why this proposal is important

JavaScript and Web standards will be better if they can take feedback from developers into account!

## Unresolved Question

Will we be able to have the impact we want it to?

## What is necessary to complete this proposal

The MVP here would be to just be able to say that this is a Foundation effort, and publish the notes in a place that's inside of a Foundation-related organization. Meetings are already happening.
