# Charter Review and Update Process
>  incubating

## Champion

Jory Burson (@jorydotcom)

## Description

Clarifies process through which projects, new and old, get reviews from the CPC related to their project charters. Project charter documents are required for all OpenJS Foundation projects.

An exception may be made for projects that came into the OpenJS Foundation as Emeritus Projects.

## Required Resources

* PROJECT_CHARTER_TEMPLATE.md (landed)
* CPC Participation & review

## Who would be responsible?

The CPC is responsible for reviewing and approving project charters. 

Should legal review of a charter be requested, the CPC Board Representative is responsible for handling that request.

## How would success be measured?

* speed and thoroughness of charter review - we have ~30 project charters to assess in the coming months related to onboarding
* ease of review - the process should be relatively frictionless where there are no concerns


## Why this proposal is important

We need a clear process to execute the number of charters we will have to review in a short amount of time, and the charters we have reviewed or updated so far have taken longer than is strictly necessary.

## Unresolved Question


## What is necessary to complete this proposal

* Approval from the CPC
