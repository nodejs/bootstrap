# Handling reports and escalation
This document describes the proposed process for handling reports and escalation, along with relevant roles in the OpenJS Foundation.

This process covers two types of reports based on ./FOUNDATION_CODE_OF_CONDUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md:

* Reports for spaces managed by the Cross Project Council (CPC) which come in through `report@opensjsf.org`
* Escalations which come in through `coc-escalation@openjsf.org`.   

Generally, reports to coc-escalation should refer to a report that was already submitted to:

* report@openjsf.org or
* one of the project's reporting emails 
* explanation of why the reportee does not feel comfortable using the previous reporting emails for the initial report

If a report to coc-esclation does not include one of those, the reportee will be asked to to provide one of those three as the 
reason for reporting to coc-escalation.

## Confidentiality and record-keeping
Personal information is confidential. All reports should be recorded, together with the discussion of it. The following private repos will be used to record and discuss reports.

* report@openjsf.org -> github.com/openjs-foundation/moderation
* coc-escalation@openjsf.org -> github.com/openjs-foundation/coc-escalation

For each report there should be an issue which captures the report, discussion and final conclusion.  The report should NOT contain identifying details of the reporter.

## Conflict of Interest

Any member of the CPC or Code of Conduct Panel(CoCP) who is involved in the report should recuse themselves from the discussions.

## Reports to report@openjsf.org

All members of the CPC are subscribed to the `report@openjsf.org` mailing list.  When a report is received the following actions will be taken:
   * One of the CPC members will respond to the reportee confirming that the report has been received. When possible the same person
     who responds initially will act as the point of contact for future conversations.
   * If no response has been sent by the next CPC meeting, the CPC chair will ensure there is a private session in which one of the
     CPC members is identified as the point of contact.
   * The point of contact will then ensure the following steps are completed:
     1. Report is acknowledged: The contact person responds to let the reportee know that the report is being discussed.
     2. Information gathering: Time is allocated to collect information in one place to make sure everyone involved has access.
     3. Information is discussed: The facts are discussed in context of opinions. This can be done in the issue for the report, or
        in a meeting in which case the key discussion points should then be added to the issue.
     4. An action to be taken is arrived at: The action to be taken is decided by consensus as per the standard CPC
        [Decision Making](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CPC-CHARTER.md#section-9-decision-making) process.
     5. Resolution offered: The resolution is offered to the reportee by the contact person. If the resolution is accepted as
        reasonable or there is no response within 7 days the process moves to the next step. If the reportee expresses concerns then the
        contact person will bring these back to the CPC members for further discussion. This cycle can continue until the 
        CPC members reach consensus that the reportee's concerns have been adquately addressed.
     6. Final resolution: the resolution agreed by the CPC members is implemented and the outcome reported to the reportee by
        the main contact.
        
## Reports to coc-escalation@openjsf.org

All members of the [Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP)](.FOUNDATION_CODE_OF_CONDUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md#code-of-conduct-panel)
are subscribed to the coc-escalation@openjsf.org mailing list. The current list of members is documented in ./CODE_OF_CONDUCT_PANEL_MEMERS.md.
     
When a report is received the following actions will be taken:

  * One of the Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP) members will respond to the reportee confirming that the report has been received.
    When possible the same person who responds initially will act as the point of contact for future conversations.
  * If no response has been sent within 1 day the Foundation Executive Director will ensure a member of the Code of Conduct
    Panel is identified as the main point of contact either through email or scheduling a meeting for the CoCP.
  * The main point of contact will then ensure the following steps are completed:
     1. Report is acknowledged: The contact person responds to let the reportee know that the report is being discussed.
     2. Information gathering: Time is allocated to collect information in one place to make sure all CoCP members have access.
     3. Information is discussed: The facts are discussed in context of opinions. This can be done in the issue for the report, or
        in a meeting in which case the key discussion points should then be added to the issue.
     4. An action to be taken is arrived at: The action to be taken is decided by consensus as per the standard CPC
        [Decision Making](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CPC-CHARTER.md#section-9-decision-making) process substituting in CoCP for references to the CPC.
     5. The proposed action is discussed with the leadership for the space to which the report applies (ex CPC or member
        project leadership). If the leadership representatives expresses concerns then the
        contact person will bring these back to the CoCP members for further discussion.  This cycle can continue  until the 
        CoCP members reach consensus that the leadership representatives concerns have been adequately addressed.
     6. Resolution offered: The resolution is offered to the reportee by the contact person. If the resolution is accepted as
        reasonable or there is no response within 7 days the process moves to the next step.  If the reportee expresses concerns then the
        contact person will bring these back to the CoCP members for further discussion. This cycle can continue until the 
        CoCP members reach consensus that the reportee's concerns have been adequately addressed. This may also require that
        step 5 be repeated as well if the proposed action is modified.
     6. Final resolution: the resolution agreed by the CoCP members is implemented and the outcome reported back to the reportee by
        the main contact.
