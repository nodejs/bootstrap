## Description

This proposal codifies the process for projects should do before exiting the foundation. It includes a checklist to be used by the projects and the foundation when the project is exiting the OpenJS Foundation.

## Who would be responsible?

The Project, The Foundation

## Why this proposal is important?

A project can leave the foundation because of the following reason:

* Project decided to leave the foundation

> There are many other reasons. We will focus on the above reason to codify the basic criteria then expand the reasons.

It is important to codify this process that will ensure transparent and efficient way of removing a project from the foundation and informing everybody about this.

## What is necessary to complete this proposal?

* Board buy in and approval to leave the foundation
* Receive a two-thirds supermajority vote of the CPC to remove the project.

The project should: 
* transfer its assets to another non-profit [a (c)6 or (c)3 in the US].
* remove all the references to foundation.
* return all the infra, assets provided by the foundation.

The foundation should: 
* remove the project references.
* revoke access to any assets provided by the foundation.

Other questions:
* What should we do if the project is in any investigation (like Code of Conduct breach)?
* How we should educate the users about this removal?
