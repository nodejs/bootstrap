# Handling reports and escalation
This document describes the proposed process for handling reports and escalation, along with relevant roles in the OpenJS Foundation.

Reporting to the OpenJS Foundation either concerns a matter with the Foundation or is considered an escalation where insufficient resolution was provided by a project, with regards to violations of the Code of Conduct.

## Channels
* Email: report@openjsf.org
* Form: It would be easier on the reportee to have a form template to help them structure their report. The form submission could trigger an email.
* Repo: Discussion of the reports happen in [private repo](TBD).
## Confidentiality and record-keeping
Everything reported and discussed is confidential unless explicitly stated. For any facts to be made public, the reportee’s explicit permission is needed. All reports should be recorded, together with the discussion of it. A private moderation repo would satisfy the need for recordkeeping.
## Steps/Escalation
1. A report is filed: This is the first step, mostly defined in [Channels](#Channels) above.
2. On call staff are alerted: See [Roles](#Roles).
3. Contact person assigned: See [Roles](#Roles).
4. Report is acknowledged: The contact person responds to let the reportee know that the report is being discussed.
5. Information gathering: Time is allocated to collect information in one place to make sure everyone involved has access.
6. Information is discussed: The facts are discussed in context of opinions. Also see **What to look forward to** for guidelines on appropriate response.
7. An action to be taken is arrived at: The action to be taken is decided by consensus (see section on [Consensus process](#Consensus-process)) involving the roles listed in the next section.
8. Resolution offered: The resolution is offered to the reportee by the contact person. The reportee needs to accept the resolution for the matter to be resolved. If they don’t accept, go back to step 5. If there isn't a clear way to resolve the report, the report can be reviewed by the moderation team representatives from OpenJS projects to ensure that the the action and resolution are appropriate.

The report is resolved if:
* the reportee accepts the action.
* there is no communication for 21 days on behalf of the original reporter.
* the Ombudsperson decides that the resolution as it stands is the best possible outcome within the constraints of all involved.
## Roles
* CPC: The Cross Project Council must get involved in cases where a report has been escalated by a project or its team reponsible for enforcing their Code of Conduct. (TBD: role of regular and voting members)
* Moderation team representatives: Each project in the CPC which has a moderation team should have representation here. [OpenJS Foundation](https://github.com/openjs-foundation) can ask these folks if any are willing to also moderate this org.
* Ombudsperson: This person acts as an impartial intermediary between a reporter and the Foundation. They also serve to mediate between the moderation team representatives.
* Contact person: This is a sensitive matter. Each reportee should only have to become comfortable talking with 1 person who represents them to the representatives.
## Consensus process
_To be added after deliberation in CPC._
