# Handling reports and escalation
This document describes the proposed process for handling reports and escalation, along with relevant roles in the OpenJS Foundation.

Reporting to the OpenJS Foundation either concerns a matter with the Foundation or is considered an escalation where insufficient resolution was provided by a project, with regards to violations of the Code of Conduct.

## Channels
* Email: report@openjsf.org.
* Form: It would be easier on the reportee to have a form template to help them structure their report. The form submission could trigger an email.
* Repo: openjs/moderation (not provisioned). As commented in PR review, hosting sensitive personal information on GitHub needs due consideration, review, and possibly legal consultation.
  * A form submission could open an issue in the repo, to allow folks to discuss in context.
## Confidentiality and record-keeping
Everything reported and discussed is confidential unless explicitly stated. For any facts to be made public, the reportee’s explicit permission is needed. All reports should be recorded, together with the discussion of it. A private moderation repo would satisfy the need for recordkeeping.
## Steps/Escalation
1. A report is filed: This is the first step, mostly defined in Channels above.
2. The right people are alerted: See Roles.
3. Contact person assigned: See Roles.
4. Report is acknowledged: The contact person responds to let the reportee know that the report is being discussed.
5. Facts are gathered: Time is allocated to collect information in one place to make sure everyone involved has access.
6. Facts are discussed: The facts are discussed in context. Also see What to look forward to for guidelines on appropriate response.
7. An action to be taken is arrived at: The action to be taken is decided by consensus.
8. Resolution offered: The resolution is offered to the reportee by the contact person. The reportee needs to accept the resolution for the matter to be resolved. If they don’t accept, go back to step 5. If there isn't a clear way to resolve the report, the report can be reviewed by the moderation team representatives from OpenJS projects to ensure that the the action and resolution are appropriate.
The report is resolved: The report is resolved when the reportee accepts the action.
## Roles
* Moderation team representatives: Each project in the CPC which has a moderation team should have representation here. https://github.com/openjs-foundation can ask these folks if any are willing to also moderate this org.
* Ombudsperson: This person acts as an impartial intermediary between a reporter and the Foundation. They also serve to mediate between the moderation team representatives.
* Contact person: This is a sensitive matter. Each reportee should only have to become comfortable talking with 1 person who represents them to the representatives.
## Further questions
* How do we protect privacy?
* How do we investigate?
* What are the conflicts of interest?
* How to avoid conflicts of interest?
* Does this relate to the work of the Node.js and other projects’ moderation team?
## What to look forward to
* Beacon project
* Code of Conduct Project: A cross-project collaboration between multiple open source tech communities RxJS, AngularJS, Node.js, Vue.js etc to find consensus on Code of Conducts. Progress is rapid and can add definition to our own process (where possible) within 6 months. Recommend incorporating the findings and avoid duplication of effort.
