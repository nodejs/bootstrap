# Project Progression Proposal
>  Stage 3

## Champion

Jory Burson (@jorydotcom)

## Description

The [PROJECT_PROGRESSION.md][] document describes the process and criteria for any project to join the foundation and 'graduate' to a 'Top Level Project.' This proposal incorporates ideas from the CNCF, the JSF, and the [Community Drafting Doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qUcvZz4wmQtwcWu9rWjxFNmWw5plD9-4_7mtvQvCegk/edit#slide=id.g45c3106792_4_115).

Note that this document will utilize the naming conventions that are to be determined in [#44](https://github.com/nodejs/bootstrap/issues/44#issuecomment-440026298). 

## Required Resources

Approval of the bootstrap team.

## Who would be responsible?

In the merged organization, the CPC would be responsible for shepherding this process. In the interim, I believe the Bootstrap team and respective boards.

## Why this proposal is important

Existing projects need to know what their "status" will be in the new organization. Potential projects need to know what the criteria and requirements are of Foundation projects.
