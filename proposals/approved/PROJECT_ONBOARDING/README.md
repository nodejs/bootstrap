## Description

This proposal codifies the process for new projects applying to join the foundation. It includes a project application template and a checklist to be used to onboard projects as part of being accepted into the OpenJS Foundation.

## Required Resources

* General support from the CPC
  - Keep track of applying projects
  - Ongoing communication with applying projects
  - Mentoring projects as they onboard
* General support from the CPC Director
  - Updates to Board of Directors of OpenJS Foundation
* Project Management support from OpenJS Foundation.
  - Keep track of applying projects
  - Ongoing communication with project

## Who would be responsible?

This document would belong to the CPC to update and use moving forward. Large changes may require board approval.

## How would success be measured?

Initially we should measure this document's success by how well it helps us onboard our current projects into the new Foundation system. We expect that it might also be successfully used to help would-be foundation projects understand what to expect after joining.

## Why this proposal is important

We need to share a workflow and understanding of what steps are required to bring in projects to the OpenJS Foundation. This process is an attempt to organize our ideas and our work to make that happen effectively. This process should be explicit and consistent to make applications fair for all projects.

## Things we plan to iterate on

* Suggestion: group all the per-repo info we're looking for in one place (such as issue trackers, lists of committers, links to documentation such as Governance.md ) 
* Clarification: to vendor dependencies include transitive dependencies as well? Also dev, prod dependencies or both?
* Suggestion: include a tool such as https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-checker for grabbing dependency info
* Suggestion: clarify the purpose of the request for list of committers (for staging purposes) and what measurements are to be used.
* Clarification: what kind of information do we want to gather on a 'whole project' vs. 'per repo' basis bearing in mind there may be some variability across some project repositories.
