# Expectations

With the intent to merge the Node.js Foundation and JS Foundation being announced, those interested in the continued support of Node.js and JS-related projects are working through expectations and structure for what the potential new foundation could look like.

This document is for the initial phase of work for the Bootstrap team to draft requirements that overlap with scope of the Board in order to provide an outline and structure for the foundation attuned to the needs of the projects and ecosystem stakeholders who have participated.

This document is organized by two key areas: concerns that must be included in the foundation bylaws, and those that are communicated expectations that aren't required to be in our legal documents to proceed but are vital to managing expectations of project members and ecosystem stakeholders.

## Bylaws requirements
- Communicated scope for the foundation and board 
- Annual reviews of staff, NPS, board, programs, support services to projects for accountability and incremental improvement 
- The foundation staff, executive director, and board should follow a leadership style that prioritizes and promotes the well-being of the project and those who prioritize and promote a healthy project and ecosystem. 
- Project representation on the Board where the broader and longer-term issues important to the success of the overall JavaScript ecosystem can discussed, championed and supported
    - Community Representation should sit on the Board directly. Projects could share this representation. 
    - Community representation on the Board: 3 seats guaranteed for community representation 
- Board must establish Cross Project Council focused on the specific needs of the member projects 
    - Allow projects to self-organize amongst themselves. Processes are defined and driven by project e.g. CPC is not structured by the Board 
- Non-corporate member representation in budget/finance subcommittee
- Creation of the budget and oversight/approval of the spending of that budget against the allocation can be delegated to collaborators in the project.
- Projects values should drive foundation focus and priority 
- No "pay to play" in technical participation 
- Earmarking allowed with flexibility in budgeting for concerns and needs of individual projects 
- Value satisfaction: regular feedback from projects 
- Explicit acknowledgement and documention for the ability of projects to leave the foundation 
- Foundation should document a clear process for trademark usage to enable community not-for-profit efforts
- Communicated scope for the foundation and board
  - Annual reviews of staff, NPS, board, programs, support services to projects for accountability and incremental improvement
  - The Foundation staff, executive director, and board should follow a "servant leadership" style.
  - Non-corporate member representation in budget / finance subcommittee
  - Projects values should drive foundation focus and priority
  - Earmarking allowed with flexibility in budgeting for concerns and needs of individual projects
  - Value satisfaction: regular feedback from projects

### Mission Statement Drafts
Projects joining the foundation should collectively agree on a _single mission statement_ when joining the new Foundation. Below are a number of rough drafts put forward by attendees of the Governance breakout session(s) at our Node.js Collaborator Summit 2018 in Vancouver.

 > By providing structure and support to build and sustain community among open-source projects.

 > Growing and maintaining the global JavaScript system through open, equitable, and inclusive governance.

 > The Foundation is dedicated to the development and sustainability of the JavaScript ecosystem, through fostering the environment for growth of JavaScript related projects.

 > The Foundation envisions a future where JavaScript is a sustainable platform for implementing best in class experiences in production across all types of workloads. The $FOUNDATION is committed to being a catalyst across the industry making our technological communities productive, sustainable, equitable, diverse and inclusive.

### Vision Statement Drafts
