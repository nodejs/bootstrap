# JavaScriptLandia - Phase 1 - Spec
## October 2020 

### Summary
JavaScriptLandia is a place where all JavaScript developers, whether if you're all about TypeScript, a React evangelist, or you stick to Node.js, gather to declare their support for the JavaScript ecosystem and OpenJS. 

### Phase 1 Components

**Launch Announcement**

This will be a blog post on the OpenJS Site
Developed in partnership with the content team at the LF/OpenJSF
We will determine the best date to post with the content team

Design requirements:
* Image of a country with multiple JS Libraries
* Image will be created by LF/OpenJSF internal team, we also can source iterations of it on Twitter or Github

**Website Changes**

A signup page where supporters can become members and pay for their yearly membership. We plan to adopt the auto join functionality from the Linux Foundation. 

An automated workflow to add new supporters to monthly email
* Existing subscribers will not be removed
* They can request removal at any time
* Zapier or IFTT can work if no other solution

A new platform for the weekly emails, and a designed template. 
    
A page to reflect current supporters on the website

A swag store for supporters (turnkey)

**A Logo and Badge**

Inspirations and Suggestions:
* An anthropromorphic passport, with JS branding
* A little playful
* Binocs
* Fanny pack
* Tourguide flags
* Map
* Passport person is traveling to see everything, doesnâ€™t have a destination
* Topography instead of countries
* Play on the passport is the digital badge


Logo Things to avoid:

* Transportation mediums
* Anything that suggests nationalism/closed borders
* Anything that suggests a certain nationality or race
* Something too esoteric
* Maps or directions that get you to a certain destination

### Open Questions

Should the logo and badge be different?
