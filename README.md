# The OpenJS Foundation Cross Project Council

The OpenJS Foundation Cross Project Council (CPC) is the technical governing body of the OpenJS Foundation. It is described in the [CPC Charter](./CPC-CHARTER.md)

## CPC Scope

The CPC's primary role is to foster an environment of collaboration. That environment extends within and between OpenJS Foundation Projects. It also extends between the Projects and the larger community.

The CPC exercises autonomy in managing its responsibilities and seeks agreement from the OpenJS Foundation Board on any change to the scope of those responsibilities.

#### Growth & At Large Project Representatives

According to the [CPC Charter](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CPC-CHARTER.md#voting-members), each of the Growth and At Large Projects may nominate a candidate to fill one of two voting seats on the CPC which represent this group of projects as a whole. Currently, the five individuals listed below were nominated during the bootstrap process and [the bootstrap committee decided](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/152) that all nominees would be given a voting seat until a process for nomination and election of these representatives was formalized.

- **Architect**: Kris Borchers (@kborchers)
- **messageformat**: Eemeli Aro (@eemeli)

## Policy Change Proposal Process

The OpenJS CPC is chartered to oversee the technical governance of all OpenJS Projects and Working Groups under the OpenJS Foundation. The CPC establishes the default governance, conduct, and licensing policies for all Projects. Projects have broad powers of self-governance.

Anyone may submit an idea for a policy or program following the [staging process](STAGING_PROCESS.md).

The pull request can be labeled cross-project-council-agenda to request that it be put on the agenda for the next CPC meeting.

The OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors retains certain rights (especially legal considerations). If the CPC endorses a proposal, they will escalate to the OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors when required to do so.
