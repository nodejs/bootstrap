## Agenda

### Announcements

*Extracted from **cross-project-council-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **openjs-foundation org** prior to the meeting.

### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* Commit to providing a reply to an application within a specific time frame [#295](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/295)
  * Michael: discussion in previous CPC meeting was that we were not comfortable comiting to
    a specific time.  Instead we agreed to commit to an initial response in 48 hours and then a
    weekly update.  This is covered in:
    https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/321

* Clarification about whether an application becomes private or public [#327](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/327)
  * Application is private by default as submitted, but after approval application can be made public with consent of both parties
 * It would possibly be helpful to have a short list of canonical approved applications to provide examples & ways to encourage other applicants
 * Action Item: propose some text to clarify that the application is private; possibly iterate on language that encourages a process to make public versions of the applications available.

* Administering Project Applications [#331](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/331)
  * Would be great if there were tooling we can take advantage of, in order to provide some helpful ‘pokes’ and some metrics around how we’re doing.
  * Private GH project repo & other ideas discussed. Folks will continue to explore & discuss

* Post-Bootstrap work to be managed by CPC [#115](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/115)
