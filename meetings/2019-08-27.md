#### Old Business

* charter: s/maintainers/governing body [#305](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/305) (related issue: [#289](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/289))
Last week’s AI: Need to get Board ok, then once 14 days has passed, should be ready to land.

This one was discussed at the board. Needs the 14 days or an approval by a quorum of voting members. Board agreed to do that via email instead of waiting for next meeting. This needs to be approved by the CPC first but will be approved in short order by the board when that is done.

AI: CPC voting members need to vote to approve or there are 7(?) Days remaining on this PR
AI, unrelated: examine issues related to getting voting members in for quorum

* doc: add governance for adding regular members [#297](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/297) (related issue: [#263](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/263)
Last week’s AI: none

There was a comment about making this more explicit. This PR clarifies this process and documentation. So far we have 2 approvals and no outstanding issues. Would like to have more approvals but otherwise there are 3 more days left before it can be merged. 

AI: remove agenda tag and close after 14 days is up (3 more days)

* Duplicate onboarding checklist [#288](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/288) (related PR:  [#304](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/304)
Last week’s AI: continued discussion on pr 304

Discussion continued on the PR. Documentation is in line - already saw that there is some discrepancy between the copies. Looking for more sign-offs or +1s. Group doesn’t necessarily want to spend too much time on this but does want to make sure there is a canonical source of truth. 

AI: Myles will make an update and more comment / sign off is requested.

* adds a draft charter template [#279](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/279)
 Last week’s AI: Jory to update PR & Send to legal for review

AI: none - still waiting on review from legal (has been sent off)

* Collaborator Summit at Node+JS Interactive / new repo [#242](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/242) (related issue: [#287](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/287) )
Last week’s AI: Wait a few days, Manil to let us know when it’s OK to initiate repo transfer.

AI: someone needs to start the transfer from the node/summit to openjs
AI, related: #190 (on /summit) improving discoverability of the summit


#### New Business

* doc: incubating projects must have a champion [#309](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/309)

Myles opened PR. doesn’t add much copy but does include the identification of a champion during the silent phase. Signals fitness and possible friction if we can’t get a supporter/champion. 

AI: Myles, Jory Tobie will find time to better differentiate roles/intent of the champion

* doc: rename acceptance criteria to graduation criteria [#294](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/294)

Generic question - does project progression qualify as governance? Gut reply is yes. This should fall under the governance rules so this has an additional 3 day period to wait before landing. 

AI: waiting 3 more days to land. Consider clarifying what falls under ‘governance’ to meet the 14 day wait period. 

AD HOC Board update
Held last week. Some gov. Changes approved others are good but waiting for process
On the front of looking for venues for looking at venues for node + js 2020, late spring early summer is the timeframe they are looking for, also looking at Oct.
