* Administering Project Applications 
[#331](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/331)
Last update was we had a public onboarding repo, and looking into a private repo. 
Private repo has been requested from GitHub and we are waiting.  Jory to check with Brian on the capability to create private repo.

* Responsible security disclosures [#326](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/326)

* Post-Bootstrap work to be managed by CPC [#115](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/115)

Gone through board, checked off relevant issues and checkboxes that are completed.

*Checklist deadline for Collab Summit graduation
[openjs-foundation/project-onboarding#30](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/project-onboarding/issues/30)
Voting is relatively quick and happens asynchronously. That said thereâ€™s still a lot of blocked issues (e.g. the Code of Conduct changes discussed before) that are going to make it really difficult to graduate by the Collab Summit.

* Communication channel between CPC and AMP infra WG [openjs-foundation/project-onboarding#31](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/project-onboarding/issues/31)
CPC do decide which communication channel is preferred between dedicated mailing list and foundation Slack.
