## Agenda

### Announcements

### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* email address for the voting members [#236](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/236)
  * Jory: for now projects email list should be ok. But need private thread for voting
    members.
  * Chris, may be people on the projects who are not members of CPC. Feel
    it may not be a great place to post cpc stuff, was meant to be for project
    Maintainers, believe there should be a separate email for private stuff.
  * Joe, not sure what would be on email as general CPC stuff should be public
    anyway.
  * Myles +1, should be using issues
  * Agreed we don’t need one for regular members, issue closed.

* Who can be an Observer? [#234](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/234)

     Joe will create PR to clarify in governance.
