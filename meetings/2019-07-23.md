* Update/move jsf-clabot for new fdn [#124](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/124)
  *  no updates, in progress

* Post-Bootstrap work to be managed by CPC [#115](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/115)
  
* #261, There appears to be some bug or issue with GH preventing me from committing changes to   the PR. I've reached out to GH support but no response so far. @joesepi was having a similar issue on a PR I submitted last week. Once this is solved I should be able to take action on this PR.
* #262, Have created an Project Onboarding Issue template & met with @kborchers & @boneskull   to start filling this out for architect and mocha #267. There's a new Project Board. Have triage some stuff into it.
* Related to above, identified several issues that may block people from completing onboarding - #265 is about how & where we store contact details for projects, #266 is about providing some guidelines for displaying OpenJS Foundation logo on their websites, #207 is about project charters (we need a template & I believe were going to get one from the LF or Board), #258 is about the copyright notice, and last but not least we need to define our CoC escalation path so that projects can incorporate it #160.
  * Brian took the action to provide a template charter.
