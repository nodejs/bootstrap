  * Feedback has gone back to the Board, we should be able to close out 583.

* Develop annual review process for projects [#592](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/592)
  * Dylan mentions Intern wouldn’t want to move to Impact. They’re happy at Growth and would be OK to move to At Large. Input would be useful to this broader conversation.
  * Decision to have two work sessions on this topic in the next two upcoming CPC meetings.

* Rename project-onboarding repo to project-status [#641](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/641)
  TL: Roadmapping should follow similar process to proven onboarding process.
    Having one repo simplifies review tasks.
    3-5 weighed in and approved.  Need approval from larger group.
  JS: 10 thumbs so far.  Objections?
  JS: MD, how does this work in Node?
  MD: Open issue, wait a few days.  Can undo easily enough if someone objects post facto.
  TL: Next steps?  (Turns out TL has necessary perms to rename)
  Various: I didn’t know we had rename perms.

    Goal to release early October.
    Lots of TODOs we need help on.  Please leave comments and thumbs up/down on #639.
    Goal is phase 2, then put before board.
    Is phase 3 in 2 weeks a reasonable goal?
  MD suggested wet set deadline for objections 1 week from now to land at phase 2, JS: Sounds
  reasonable
  [No objections]
