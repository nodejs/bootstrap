* Google Summer of Code 2021 [#673](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/673)
If applying as a project and can support a mentee, go ahead.  Can help smaller projects.
Umbrella projects get extra slots.
It’s a shared slot, so we might have to figure out how to allocate mentees if demand > availability.
Let’s not submit at deadline (19 Feb) as we’ve done in past.  Let’s aim for first two weeks of Feb.
JS: Let’s put this on projects’ radars via slack.

* Remove Growth Stage [#650](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/650)
Could use more eyes

* Provide implementation guidance for DCO/CLA [#632](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/632)
BW: Remediation commit support makes it easier to use DCO if DCO check failed.  Fewer abandoned commits.  Discussed with probot maintainer, waiting for guidance.
Three pillars
