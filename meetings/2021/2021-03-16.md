### openjs-foundation/summit

* Collaborator summit this year ?  [#306](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/summit/issues/306)
  * Online collab summit was not as useful
  * Doing it along with the conference was also not as useful, since it was online. If we have to do it online, delaying it would be preferred
  * Didn’t feel much different from working groups
  * Consensus: Let’s not push to do a event alongside the OpenJS World event;
  * Action: File an issue to take volunteers for planning “something else” in the “fall”

### openjs-foundation/cross-project-council

* Private slack channel for Node.js build team machine management [#729](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/729)
  * some info may be sensitive, hence the need for privacy
  * Question about the owner / admin level 
  * Action - create channel

* doc: add travel fund allocation for 2021 [#725](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/pull/725)

 * apologies for the delay updating from the agreed budget in later 2020
 * funds allocated based on what the planned travel might be in Q4 2021
 * Discussing with the board via email, several ideas floating around 

* Rename master branches [#711](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/711)
  * Suggestion to announce to projects
  * Discuss any issues in #infra
  * Action: Jory to email maintainers, possibly using Tobie’s template (in the comments); point folks to #infra for additional support

* Improving Diversity and Inclusion at the OpenJSF [#699](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/699)

  * TODO: follow up with attendees to create regular meeting outside of CPC working group sessions
  * Tobie notes that W3C and other orgs are also in the same boat and would value connecting with them as well

* Provide implementation guidance for DCO/CLA [#632](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/632)

  * Issues testing the PR; Brian has made progress on this today. 
  * PROBot needs to add a feature for certain types of commits
  * Challenge is that this is all done on Open Source time. 
  * Brian to keep up posted
