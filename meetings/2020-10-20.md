### Working session on proposal process
* Simplify proposal process [#635](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/635)
Consensus:
* remove term staging
* Two phases: Incubating; ready for review/approval
* As many PRs as you’d like through incubating, essentially providing snapshots
* PR to move artifacts into place is the “ready for approval” phase
* A desire for a Definition of Done; perhaps checklist

Work on this was done in a shared screen and moved to a PR.
